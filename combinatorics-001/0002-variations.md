# Variations

Variations are the number of ways a subset of items can be selected and arranged from a larger set of items.

For example:

Given a set of 5 objects: `{A, B, C, D, E}`, the number of ways 3 objects can be selected and arranged in a certain 
order is 5 x 4 x 3 = 60.

## Formula

The formula for the number of variations of selecting and arranging r objects from a set of 
n objects is:

$$ V_k^n = \frac{n!}{(n - k)!} $$

where:

- n is the total number of objects in the set.
- k is the number of objects to be selected and arranged.
